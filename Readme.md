- Open a terminal or a anaconda prompt
- If desired make new enviroment: conda create -n name_of_enviroment python
- Activate enviroment conda activate: conda create name_of_enviroment
- Install dependencies: pip install requirements.txt
- If the new enviroment / kernel is supposed to be used in Jupyter, install kernel:
